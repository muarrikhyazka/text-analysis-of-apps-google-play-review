About once a week, there's an error where it ""can't connect to Netflix servers"", and then I have to log in AGAIN using an onscreen keyboard.  Implement a token system like Plex or any other reasonable 10' interface system - let me authenticate using a device that actually has a keyboard!  Voice search (both inside the app and globally) needs to happen as well - my Plex content comes up beautifully in the regular voice search.  Why not the Netflix content?  It would make this a killer combination.  That said, once you finally get logged in and find something to watch, it works great.";3;6;1.0.2 build 121;2015-01-03 13:08:31;;;like service android tv app seriously need improvement using onscreen keyboard searching logging week there error cant connect netflix server log using onscreen keyboard implement token system like plex reasonable 10 interface system let authenticate using device actually keyboard voice search inside app globally need happen well plex content come beautifully regular voice search netflix content would make killer combination said finally get logged find something watch work great;INTERFACE;POSITIVE

One time it wouldn't start, just got a black screen. Cleared cache, still wouldn't start. Had to delete and completely re-install. Since voice input doesn't work, and using your phone as a keyboard also doesn't work... making it a pain for entering passwords. Subtitles also don't work well. Text styling doesn't work, and the subtitles are always white.   Can't have separate passwords for profiles which kind of defeats the purpose it's common for people to be too lazy to change to their own profile.   Video occasionally stutters in the beginning, and the first part of the movie is usually low quality. Though it only happens about the first 10 seconds or so.  Suggestions don't show up in the home screen. Would be really nice to have at least last watched, my list, and  suggestion card on the home screen. Netflix really dropped the ball on this one.;2;3;1.0.1 build 110;2014-11-23 08:25:33;;;show gradient anything thats 169 one time wouldnt start got black screen cleared cache still wouldnt start delete completely reinstall since voice input doesnt work using phone keyboard also doesnt work making pain entering password subtitle also dont work well text styling doesnt work subtitle always white cant separate password profile kind defeat purpose common people lazy change profile video occasionally stutter beginning first part movie usually low quality though happens first 10 second suggestion dont show home screen would really nice least last watched list suggestion card home screen netflix really dropped ball one;INTERFACE;NEGATIVE
